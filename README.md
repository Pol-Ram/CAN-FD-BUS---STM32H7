# ðŸš— CAN BUS Communication in STM32 for Race Car

![Project Diagram](./CAN%20FD%20diagram.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Points

- Implements **CAN FD** protocol (higher bandwidth and speed compared to Classical CAN).  
- Data transmitted are **floating-point values** from sensors.  
- Uses **STM32H753** boards as both transmitter and receiver.  
- Communication speed configured at **500 kbps**.  
- Designed for reliable and efficient data exchange in embedded systems.
